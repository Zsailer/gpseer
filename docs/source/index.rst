*Simple software for inferring missing data in sparsely measured genotype-phenotype maps*

GPSeer uses a simple, straightforward approach to infer the missing phenotypes
from an incomplete genotype-phenotype map, with well-characterized uncertainty
in its predictions.  Such knowledge allows robust and statistically-informed
analyses of features of the map, such as knowledge of possible evolutionary
trajectories.
